# Partitioning natural number sets
## I met a lot of people and learned a lot of things today, among which were these:
- NEVER divide by 0
- sum of sets till n
- how to use blackboard and chalk
- how to solve maths problems by decomposition
- how to use trial to advantages when solving problems
- try small values and see what pattern emerges

## Original problem
