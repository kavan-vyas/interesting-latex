\section*{Notes for My Paper}

Don't forget to include examples of topicalisation.

\ex. Topicalisation from sentential subject:\\
a John$_i$ [a kltukl [el {\bf l-}oltoir er ngii$_i$ a Mary]] \\
John, (it's) clear that Mary loves (him).

\subsection*{How to handle topicalisation}

I'll just assume a tree structure like (\thex).

\ex. Structure of A$'$ Projections:\\[2ex]
\Tree [.CP Spec [.C$'$ C SAgrP ] ]

\subsection*{Mood}

Mood changes when there is a topic, as well as when there is WH-movement.  
\emph{Irrealis} is the mood when there is a non-subject topic or WH-phrase in Comp.  
\emph{Realis} is the mood when there is a subject topic or WH-phrase.
